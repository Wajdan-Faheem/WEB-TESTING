    <h1>CSS BASICS</h1>
    <p>A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. 
        Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a 
        group of sentences that supports one central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a 
        time to your broader argument.

        <p>Paragraphs get too long, extending beyond the acceptable research text range of 100-200 
            words to take up 300 words or more. ... If a paragraph falls between 200 and 250 words
             this might be retainable, so long as the wrap sentence can still reconnect readers 
             back to the (now rather distant) topic sentence.Jul 17, 2017
